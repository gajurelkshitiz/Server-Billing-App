# Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is the central hub for monitoring and managing all key aspects of the Billing Backend System. It provides real-time insights and access to companies, users, subscriptions, and billing activities, tailored to the user's role (superadmin or admin).

## Key Features

- **User Management:** See all users, filter by company, and access user details.
- **Subscription Tracking:** Monitor active, expired, and upcoming subscriptions.
- **Billing Summary:** Review recent bills, outstanding payments, and billing history.
- **Role-Based Access:**
  - Superadmins see all companies, users, and subscriptions across the system.
  - Admins see only the companies and users they manage.
- **Notifications:** Alerts for overdue bills, expiring subscriptions, and important system events.

## Typical Dashboard Sections
1. **Header:** Quick links to main sections (Companies, Users, Subscriptions, Bills, Settings).
2. **Statistics Widgets:**
   - Total companies, users, and subscriptions
   - Outstanding and paid bills
   - Recent activity logs
3. **Tables/Lists:**
   - Companies with key info (name, status, subscription plan)
   - Users with roles and company assignments
   - Subscriptions with renewal dates
   - Bills with status (pending, paid, overdue)
4. **Filters and Search:**
   - Filter by company, user, status, or date range
   - Search for specific records
5. **Actions:**
   - Add/edit/delete companies, users, subscriptions, and bills (as permitted by role)
   - Export data for reporting

## Access Control
- **Superadmin:** Full access to all dashboard features and data.
- **Admin:** Access limited to their assigned companies and users.
- **User:** Typically has no dashboard access or only limited self-service views.

## Best Practices
- Regularly review dashboard statistics to monitor business health.
- Use filters to quickly find relevant data.
- Respond promptly to notifications about overdue bills or expiring subscriptions.
- Ensure only authorized users have admin or superadmin access.

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing Data:** Check your role and permissions. Superadmins see all data; admins see only their scope.
- **Outdated Information:** Refresh the dashboard or check backend server status.
- **Access Denied:** Ensure you are logged in with the correct role.
